Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

        def createLPS(needle):
            preLPS, i = 0, 1
            lps = [0] * len(needle)
            while i<len(needle):
                if needle[i] == needle[preLPS]:
                    preLPS += 1
                    lps[i] = preLPS
                    i += 1

                        lps[i] = 0
                        i += 1
                    else:
                        preLPS = lps[preLPS -1]
            return lps
        
        i = j = 0
        lps = createLPS(needle)
        while i<len(haystack):
            if haystack[i] == needle[j]:
                i+=1
                j+=1
            else:
                if j == 0:
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j = lps[j-1]
            if j== len(needle):
                return i-len(needle)
        return -1
